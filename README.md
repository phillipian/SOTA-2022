# State of the Academy 2021

The digital publication for *The Phillipian*'s annual State of the Academy survey project by Jeffrey Shi '22 Digital Editor CXLIV and Jessica He '22 Digital Editor CXLIV. Built using sota.js.

On April 12, *The Phillipian*, vol. CXLIV, sent out the 2021 “State of the Academy” survey to all Andover students in the hopes of obtaining valuable information about the school community.

Despite two classes being unfamiliar with a printed version of the State of the Academy, *The Phillipian* received a participation rate of 81.8% of the student body—949 participants. The anonymous survey asked a comprehensive set of 183 questions, comprised of ten sections: General, Politics & Worldview, Wellness, Sex, Drugs & Alcohol, School, Campus Culture, Community Diversity, Discipline, and Covid-19. 

This year, the survey included content warnings that allowed participants to skip specific questions that may have been potentially triggering without viewing the question itself. We sincerely thank members of the student body for their willingness to share information and personal experiences for this special issue of *The Phillipian*, and we hope that the State of the Academy will serve to inform, enlighten, and create a more holistic narrative of the students at Andover.
